Engineer at heart. Been tinkering with Linux since I was a kid, and never stopped. Today I build platforms that development teams can rely on. Stable, secure, scalable.

Bridging infrastructure and business: translating technical complexity into solutions that actually deliver value. Hands-on with AWS, Kubernetes, OpenShift, Terraform, Python, Golang and Bash. From startup to enterprise, from greenfield to migration. No powerpoints, just working systems.
